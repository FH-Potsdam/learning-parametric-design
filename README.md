# Parametric Design
![Parametric Design](https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/learning-parametric-design/blob/main/thumbnail.png?raw=true)
This is the companion repository for the ["Learning Parametric Design"](https://github.com/fh-potsdam/teaching-parametric-design) repository at the [design department](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/design/) at the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences.

## Welcome to parametric design ðŸ‘‹
This seminar is an introduction creating design artifacts with code. In contrast to other creative coding classes, we take a specific focus on how to use code to create digital artifacts that we can use in other software or even rapid prototyping tools like laser cutters/engravers, CNC milling machines, 3D-printers or even stitching machines.

You need no prior knowledge of any of those tools and systems. You just need to bring a little curiosity.
